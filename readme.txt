Pop-ups for sales and lead generation. All in one powerful tool.

== Description ==

Imagine targeting each of your visitors with the perfect message—at exactly the right time. WisePops will boost and maximize your on-site conversions with automated popups. 

This plugin automatically installs the WisePops tracking code properly across your website.

With WisePops you can:

* Add new visitors to your newsletter and grow your list by up to 300%
* Catch exiting visitors before they leave your website
* Target AdWords visitors with coupons and promotions
* Connect mobile visitors to your social media profiles 
* Collect feedback from visitors exploring your website 
* Retain visitors leaving on your top exit page
* And so, so, much more. 

Each pop-up can target specific user profiles (new or returning, mobile or desktop, local or international), at a specific time (on landing, on scroll or on exit), with a targeted call to action (sign-up, click, share, give feedback). 

Optimize every aspect of your pop-up, from color and copy ­to targeting and timing. Then test and track everything yourself with our our A/B testing features. 

WisePops is trusted by 2,000+ companies, including BBC, Kiehl’s and Greenpeace.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does setting up WisePops require any coding? =

Nope, just use this plugin!

= How does the free trial work? =

Our 14-day free trial gives you access to all the features of your plan. You don’t need a credit card to sign up and there’s no commitment required. Create as many pop-ups as you want. After the 14 days are over, we’ll give you the option to upgrade. At that point, we’ll ask for your credit card information and you’ll be billed for the monthly subscription of your choice.

= Can I control where and how my pop-up is displayed? =

WisePops gives you more control over how your pop-ups are displayed than any other tool. Display pop-ups on landing, scroll, exit or after a certain number of minutes or pages. You can display them on select URLs.

= Can I turn off WisePops on specific pages? =

Absolutely. Avoid displaying your pop-ups on specific URLs (like the shopping cart page) or stop displaying them altogether after a certain number of displays or after sign-up.

Yes. Any emails collected via WisePops are 100% your property and we have no claim on them whatsoever.
